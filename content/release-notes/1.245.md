# Build 245

2023-03-21
## Features
### Website Monitoring

The website monitoring now supports uploading Javascript sourcemap to parse stack trace with error beacons.


## Improvements


### Db2LUW Sensor
#### Metrics improvements

A `hadr_log_gap` metric is added in the HADR configuration. The `hadr_log_gap` metric is a measure of the difference between the primary log sequence number (LSN) and the standby log LSN.
A `log_utilization_percent` metric, which shows the total log space used in percentage, is added to the database section.


### Open Beta
#### Synthetic Monitoring: Filter test results with the success status

When you view the list of results for a synthetic test in the **Results** tab of the Synthetic Monitoring UI, you can filter the list of results to view only the successful results. In earlier releases, you could filter the list to view the failed results, but could not view the successful results. Now you can select either the failed status or successful status in the filter to affect the list of results.
By default, all results are shown in the **Results** tab of the Synthetic Monitoring UI.

If you click the **Results** tab from a Synthetic Smart Alert in the Events UI, you can see only the failed results that are associated with that alert and timeframe. You can remove the `failed status` filter to see all results in the timeframe of the alert.

## Fixes

### Open Beta
#### Synthetic Monitoring: Fix multiple selection in the Tests tab

Previously, a pagination problem happens after you filter with multiple selection in either the **Tests** tab in the Synthetic Monitoring UI or the **Synthetic Monitoring** tab in the Applications UI. Now the problem is solved.

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Fix synthetic test input area

In the Step 2: Request details wizard of the *Create Synthetic Test* page in the Synthetic Monitoring UI, a bug where the letter `f` could not be typed into the input area is solved now.

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Fix the limit in the Tests tab

When you filter synthetic tests in the **Tests** tab of the Synthetic Monitoring UI, the number of tests is calculated dynamically based on the time window instead of using a fixed limit.

### Application tagging

A bug in application tagging makes some application perspectives display or tag immediate database and messaging services downstream incorrectly. Now this bug is fixed.
